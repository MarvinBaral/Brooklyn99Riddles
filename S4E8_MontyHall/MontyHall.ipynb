    "After you make your choice, the game host (knowing the location of the WIN) opens one door that contains a LOOSE and offers you to change.\n",
    "Appearently according to statistical definitions the probabilities have locked in after your choice and the 1/3 WIN probability falls to the other door you did not choose (as your door must somehow stay at 1/3 chance).\n",
    "This gives the door you have currently not selected a 2/3 chance of winnig and you should definetly switch.\n",
    "I personally think that is an error in the definition of statistics. The situation has changed and the winning probability should now be 1/2 for each of the two remaining doors.\n",
